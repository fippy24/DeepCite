# Setup Your Workspace.

We're using Python 3 for this development (unless we want to support Python 2.7 as well?), which is idetified by the python3 calls below.
After you've cloned this repository:
```
cd DeepCite/
python3 -m venv venv # Set up your virtual envirnoment.
source venv/bin/activate # Activate this virtual envirnoment, so pip installs just for this projec, not in t
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install all pip packages required.
```
If you need to install virtualenv, check out (their instructions)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html].
